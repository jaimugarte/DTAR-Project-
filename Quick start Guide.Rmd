**Please, follow these short steps to learn how to use this useful App. Further details about how some functionalities have been developed can be seen by clicking the *Show details* buttons.**

## Step 1 out of 5
This RShiny app allows you to keep ordered your personal incomes and expenses, and lets you visualize some useful graphs.  

Supose that you have downloaded a .xlsx file from your bank website containing your incomes and expenses of the current year ([click here](https://github.com/jaimugarte/DTAR-Project-/raw/jaime_branch/datasets/example_bank_movements.xlsx) to download a simulated .xlsx file that we will use during the start guide. Please, take 15 sec. to see the content of the file).   

## Step 2 out of 5
You can go now to **Data** in the top bar menu, click on the **Import** button located in the left side, and select the file already mentioned. You may see the content of the file in a table. Observe that each expense/income has been classified into some categories, thanks to two ingenious algorithms.

<script>
function myFunction() {
    var x = document.getElementById("myDIV");
    if (x.style.display === "none") {
        x.style.display = "block";
    } else {
        x.style.display = "none";
    }
}
</script>
 
<button onclick="myFunction()">Show details</button>
 
<div id="myDIV">
The step 1 out of 5 from the Quick Start Guide has this workflow:
1) Connect with googledrive of this app (that stores the files of this App). If it is the first time the App is used, the file is stored.
We have created a function that recieves the .xlsx bank file and deletes all the unnecessary rows and columns. As an input, it gives
